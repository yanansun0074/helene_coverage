"They were in the basement frantically preparing for a flood. Then the landslide hit
October 6, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 12
Author: MARTHA QUILLIN","They were in the basement frantically preparing for a flood. Then the landslide hit
In the Balls' basement, the water was just coming up too fast, and Kelli told Dakota, ""We've got to go. We've got to go!"" And ran upstairs.
That's when she felt the vibration in her breastbone.
She reached the living room, with its big windows that look across Stony Fork Road at a hay field, then up at a mountain that's part of Pisgah National Forest, just as the mountain turned loose a river of boulders and trees and mud.
BARNARDSVILLE
Kelli Ball felt the landslide in the bones of her chest before she could see it.
She and her husband, Dakota, were in the basement of their house on Stony Fork Road trying to move stuff out of the way of the rising water. The water was coming from the creek behind the house, normally a little trickle way down the hill, that had climbed the bank Friday morning with all
the rain from the remnants of Hurricane Helene.
Their boys, Canaan, 8, and Macon, 4, were upstairs on the couch.
It was around 10 a.m. The family had been awake since 5 a.m., and all morning, the mountains around them had been groaning in the deluge.
""If you've not experienced a flood in the mountains, you just hear these boulders rolling and trees breaking and it just rumbles in the mountains,"" Kelli said. alt echoes everywhere. We had been hearing that all
morning."" The flooding was happening all around Barnardsville, a farming community in Buncombe County north of Asheville along the normally friendly Big Ivy River and laced with creeks that come down from the hills. The Big Ivy itself was coming out of its banks and spreading all over the lowland, snatching double-wide mobile homes and stick-built houses off their foundations and sending them downstream in shards. It emptied out a catfish pond. It blew out a wall of the local diner.
It was heading hundreds of yards downhill, coming for the Balls' house, with the potential to also take out Dakota's parents' house, on one side of them, or his grandmother's, on the other.
They had picked this site when they built the home in 2019 because it was on high ground.
""We thought it was the safest place,"" Dakota said.
When Kelli saw - and felt - the liquified mountain coming at her family, she screamed at Dakota, who was still in the basement: ""Landslide!''
She grabbed the boys and went out the front door just as a whole tree slammed into the house, jamming under the porch.
""It was like a runaway freight train coming down that mountain,"" Kelli said.
The boys jumped from the porch and first the family started to run to the right, ""but the slide kept coming, n so they decided to go the other way. By then, Dakota's parents had run outside. Separated by the flow of mud and debris several feet deep running between their two houses, ""We formed a human chain and just passed our babies across that river,'' as rocks and branches ran across their bare feet in the flowing mud.
Dakota Ball said the slide opened up two new springs in the front yard, and he and others had used a track hoe to reroute them into one stream running beside the drive-way and toward the creek behind the house. The couple had stripped the dry wall in the basement, and with the help of people of Barnardsville, had cut enough of the scattered trees to move around in the yard.
A few miles down the road, in Barnardsville proper, volunteers were sorting donations of canned corn and taco shells and bottled water at the old four-bay building that used to house the volunteer fire department. The community, routed by water, already was rebuilding its washed-out roads using equipment on loan from Brock Mountain, a local construction company.
Owners of A TVs were shuttling residents where they needed to go because cars and pavement had been washed away.
""We're lucky,"" Kelli Ball said. ""We're alive."""

"No power but only minor damage: Spruce Pine quartz mine owner updates Helene recovery
October 6, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 24
Author: BRIAN GORDON","The world's main producer of high-purity quartz, a mineral crucial to the global supply of semiconductor chips, announced its shuttered Spruce Pine, North Carolina, mines have endured ""minor damage,"" according to an initial assessment conducted after Tropical Storm Helene upended the town.
""Our dedicated teams are on-site, conducting cleanup and repair activities to restart operations as soon as we can,"" the mine owner, Sibelco, wrote in an update Friday. The private Belgian company added the power remains out at its Western North Carolina mines but that repairs have ""progressed significantly.""
KAITLIN MCKEOWN kmckeown@newsobserver.com
Andrew Zook, left, helps to clear instruments and other items from the mud inside Majestic Music in downtown Spruce Pine on Thursday, days after Hurricane Helene brought heavy flooding to the area.
With around 500 employees, Sibelco is the largest employer in Mitchell County, a rural mountainous area northeast of
Asheville. The company said all its employees and contractors had been accounted for following last week's storm, which dumped more than two feet of rain on Spruce Pine and flooded the local North Toe River. Its facilities have been closed since Sept. 26.
Sibelco's mines sit north of downtown in an area called the Spruce Pine Mining District. Like much of the region, Mitchell County has sustained extensive road and rail line damage, which could hinder employees' ability to get to the mines and Sibelco's ability to move its valuable quartz.
Free of impurities, Spruce Pine quartz has been crucial to the supply of semiconductor wafers, solar panels and other fast-growing technologies.
""It is rare, unheard-of almost, for a single site to control the global snpply of a crucial material,"" wrote Ed Conway in his 2023 book ""Material World."" ""Yet if you want to get high-purity quartz -the kind you need to make those crucibles without which you can't make silicon wafers - it has to co1ne from Spruce Pine.""
Sibelco has grown to keep up with the demand. Between 2019 and 2023, the company increased its production of high-quality quartz by almost 60%. And in April 2023, Sibelco committed to invest $200 million in its Spruce Pine facilities to double production by next year.
On Friday, the company said its final product stock ""has not been impacted"" by the storm. ""We are working closely with our customers to assess their needs and plan the restart of product shipments as soon as we can/' Sibelco said.
Sibelco sells its white quartz sand under the brand name IOTA, which the company states online is ""indispensable in the manufacture of a wide range of high-tech products.""
Disruptions at the Spruce Pine mines have previously impacted the supply chain of quartz; In 2008, a fire at a local quartz refinery ""temporarily brought production to a halt and impacted the market,"" the consulting firm Global Risk Intel reported.
Sibelco isn't the only quartz mining company in Spruce Pine. In recent years, a second company named The Quartz Corp opened area mines. On Tuesday, The Quartz Corp confirmed it had also stopped operations following Helene, noting 11we have no visibility on when they will restart.""
Compared to Sibelco's sites, The Quartz Corp mine is positioned closer to the North Toe River."
"Milton takes turn to target Florida on 'destructive' path
October 9, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 12
Author: RICHARD TRIBOU","Orlando Sentinel/Tribune Content Agency 
ORLANDO, FLA.
Hurricane Milton began its tum toward Florida on Tuesday still a powerful Category 4 hurricane with a forecast landfall near Tampa Bay and projected path that will cut through Central Florida.
The powerful hurricane surged Monday into a monster Category 5 storm with 180 mph winds in the Gulf of Mexico, but lost some steam overnight as it moved over the waters just north of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
""While fluctuations in intensity are expected, Milton is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane through landfall in Florida,"" said NHC senior hurricane specialist John Cangialosi. "" Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida.""
As of 8 a.m. Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said Milton had maximumsustained winds at 145 mph located 545 miles southwest of Tampa moving east-northeast at 12 mph north of the Yucatan peninsula.
The latest forecast track ranges from Cape Coral in southwest Florida's Gulf Coast north up to Yankeetown, but the consensus path remains targeted at Tampa Bay with landfall after midnight Thursday still a major Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds and 155 mph gusts.
The forecast track has it passing south of Lakeland and Kissimmee headed toward Cape Canaveral, never losing hurricane status as it crosses the state into the Atlantic.
Its hurricane-force winds only extend out 30 miles, but tropical-storm-force winds have begun to expand, now out 105 miles, the result of an eyewall replacement cycle, Cangia losi said.
""Milton is still a relatively compact hurricane, but the wind field is expected to continue to grow in size as it approaches Florida, he said.
The forecast shows both hurricane- and tropical storm-force winds roughly doubling in size by landfall.
""Therefore, damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall will extend well outside the forecast cone,"" he said. ""It is worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation and residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their local emergency management officials.""
In Florida, a hurricane warning is in effect for the west coast from Bonita Beach north to the mouth of the Suwannee River including Tampa Bay and on the east coast from the Indian River/St. Lucie county line north to Ponte Vedra Beach.
Inland hurricane warnings are in place for parts of the southern Florida peninsula including Central Florida's Brevard, Lake, Marion, Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia counties.
Updated storm surge predictions now call for 10-15 feet from the Anclote River north of Tampa south down to Englewood including Tampa Bay in the core projected landfall area.
""We're talking about storm surge values higher than the ceiling,"" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie. ""Please. If you're in the Tampa Bay area, you need to evacuate. If they have called for your evacuation order, I beg you, I implore you, to evacuate. Drowning deaths due to storm surge are 100% preventable if you leave.""
Evacuations on much of Florida's west coast barrier islands have already begun.
""We had situations where people died of drowning in Hurricane Ian. Had they just gone across the bridge from Estero Bay, Sanibel Island and so on, just across the bridge to the first available shelter that had capacity, they'd still be alive today,"" he said.
It's forecast to continue its tum to the east-northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday and approach Florida's Gulf Coast by Wednesday night.
With mass evacuations from the Gulf Coast underway, gas stations have been running out of fuel, but the state has already begun to deploy emergency supplies since Monday night.
The state still has 268,000 gallons of diesel and 110,000 gallons of gasoline, and another 1.2 million gallons of both diesel and gasoline headed to the state."
"As Milton nears Florida, FEMA faces severe staffing shortage
October 9, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 15
Author: CHRISTOPHER FLAVELLE","NYT News Service
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is running out of staff to deal with the potential devastation of Hurricane Milton as it barrels toward Tampa with wind speeds that have reached 175 mph.
As of Monday morning, just 9% of FEMA's personnel, or 1,217 people, were available to respond to the hurricane or other disasters, according to the agency's daily operations briefing. To put that into context: Over the previous five years, one-quarter of the agency's staff was available for deployment at this point in the hurricane season.
Even in 2017 - arguably FEMA's busiest year in the past decade, after Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, Hurricane Irma plowed through Florida, and Hurricane Maria plunged Puerto Rico into darkness - FEMA's staffing reserves at this point in October were 19%, more than twice the levels they are at now.
The agency said Monday afternoon that it is well equipped to handle the strains. ""FEMA is built for this,"" said Leiloni Stains by, the agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery.
But FEMA is stretched not just by the brutal aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 200 people and destroyed sections of western North Carolina. Its staff is also responding to flooding and landslides in Vermont, tornadoes in Kansas, the aftermath of Tropical Storm Debby in New York and Georgia and the Watch Fire in Arizona.
And those are just the disasters that were declared in the past two weeks.
""The agency is simultaneously supporting over 100 major disaster declarations,"" Brock Long, who led FEMA during the Trump administration, said
in a statement. ""The scale of staffing required for these operations is immense. n
Now FEMA must find staff members to deploy to Florida, where Milton is on track to plow into Tampa, prompting officials to prepare for what could be the largest evacuation since 2017.
The relentless string of disasters, which are becoming more frequent and severe because of climate change, is just one challenge.
In a report last year, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that 35% of FEMA's positions were unfilled, partly because of ""rising disaster activity during the year, which increased burnout and employee attrition.""
The agency also faces a funding crunch. Congress last week approved FEMA's request to top up its disaster relief fund. That was before Hurricane Milton, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week said FEMA needed additional funding from Congress to make it through the hurricane season. Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to call House lawmakers back from the campaign trail for an emergency session to fund hurricane relief and rebuilding.
Still, the most immediate problem for FEMA is finding enough people.
It's not just the top-line staff numbers that jump out. According to Monday's briefing, some of FEMA' s most highly trained personnel, which are grouped into what the agency calls ""cadres,"" are at particularly low levels.
As of Monday morning, of the 2,579 people who work in the agency's Individual Assistance cadre, four were available to deploy to Florida. Four of the 94 people who work in the safety cadre were available. And just one of the 1,201 people working in disaster survivor assistance could be dispatched."
"Charlotte teams help UNC Asheville recover post-Helene
October 11, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 18
Author: LANGSTON WERTZ JR lwerlz@charlotteobserver.com","Janet Cone has been athletic director at UNC Asheville for 21 years. She intentionally built a house in an area where, even when the snow and bad weather would come - and it always comes in the mountain winters - Cone knew she could still get to work.
That was until Hurricane Helene blew through Asheville last week, delivering a double-fisted blow of wind and Janet Cone rain like the area had not seen since ""The Great Flood"" of 1916.
Businesses closed. Nearly 100 lives were lost. The power went out. The water stopped working. ""In the 20-something years
I've been here,"" Cone said, ""I don't think I've ever not been able to get work until that Friday. My neighborhood wasn't bad. There were trees blown all over, but when you came out to the county road and you look to the right, it was like, 'Well I can't go that way.' There just trees and power lines down. Then I looked to the left and it was the same thing. ""All I could do was go back
home."" Like many people in the area, Cone didn't really know how bad things were.
She couldn't turn on the TV, although she did find an old transistor radio that could pick up one station. By Sunday, she could finally get a cellphone signal, and one of the first messages she read was from Charlotte 49ers AD Mike Hill. How can I help you? ""At first, I told Mike, 'Let me get back to you,'"" Cone said. ""My first thing was to make sure our students were safe. We were making sure we could get student-athletes off campus.""
THE AFTERMATH ON CAMPUS
When Cone finally got to UNC Asheville, she was able to see the damage, which included a building that houses athletic offices, golf and tennis locker rooms being flooded with water that was, she said, between eight and 12 feet high.

Thomasson said the Asheville athletes moved onto campus at Charlotte on Monday and have been using the 49ers' team facilities or campus rec centers for things like weight training and watching film. The Ashe- ville athletes eat in the 49ers' dining hall.
In a statement provided to The Observer, the Hornets said they have ""a long-standing"" relation- ship with UNC Asheville, including hosting the NBA team for training camp and a preseason game. Beginning this week, the Bulldogs' basketball teams will use the practice facil- ity at Spectrum Center, including the Novant Health Training Center. On days when the space is not available, the Hornets said they will secure addi- tional facilities for the Asheville teams to use.
""We're proud to return the favor and host them at our home, especially dur- ing this time of need,"" the team said in its statement.
'NO PLAYBOOKFOR SOMETHING LIKETHIS'
There are about 95,000 people who live in Ashe- ville, which is bordered by the French Broad and the Swannanoa, which makes the city and the region susceptible to floods.
And when the city was blanketed by heavy rain, ahead of Helene last week, men's basketball coach Mike Morrell knew it could be bad.
He canceled a Friday practice and prepared for the worst.
He said the worst of the storm blew through Thursday night and, the next morning, he walked to a bridge that look out over the famous River Arts District near where he lives. Morrell said he liter- ally had to crawl through trees to get there.
""I wanted to see what the river was like,"" he said. ""They had talked about how high it could get.""
He stood there looking, he said, with about 30-40 people. And when he tried to go back, just a few hours later, the bridge he had been standing on was under water.
""That was the first time, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this ain't good,'"" Morrell said.
Morrell said his players lost power about 7:30 a.m. Friday and he lost it about 30 minutes after that. Phones worked for little while longer, but when they went dark, it was hard to know what was going on.
""It was like you were in 'The Truman Show,' or 'The Hunger Games,'
where everybody can see what's going on top of you,n Morrell said, ""and you don't know what they're seeing.""
Morrell checked on his family in Tennessee, also affected by the storm, and then circled back to his players, who by then, had lost running water.
""We had to get the guys out of town, man,"" he said. ""This is not safe.""
The mother of fifth-year guard Josh Banks - who played at Charlotte's Olympic High School - drove up and Morrell said she took some guys back to Charlotte. Two other players, Kam Taylor and Jordan Marsh, both from the Charlotte-area, also drove back, taking team- mates with them.
By Monday, all of Mor- rell's players had all got- ten to Charlotte and in the team hotel.
""I told our players there is really no playbook for this,"" Morrell said.
""You're asking for a lot of grace from a lot of people in Charlotte. It makes you feel good but it's really not surprising. I would like to think that we would do the exact same thing. So we're just inconvenienced right now. That's all this is. We're not without power and water the way some people are in western North Carolina or Ten- nessee or Georgia, or people in Florida having to evacuate (due to Hurricane Milton).
""So we're inconve- nienced, but we're also thankful. It's probably not the only time in life you'll find yourself in a situation like this."""
"Millions without power as Florida begins recovery
October 13, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 18
Author: JOHN YOON","NYT News Service
Florida residents were returning to their homes Friday to begin a long recovery after Hurricane Milton carved a path of destruction through the state. Millions of customers remained without power.
The storm leveled homes along its path, flooded coastal communities and areas of central Florida, and spawned deadly tornadoes on the state's Atlantic Coast.
Florida's preparations -including its building code and dire warnings from officials that prompted
one of the largest evacuations in the state's history- probably limited the impact. The hurricane also largely spared the densely populated cities in the Tampa Bay area from the high storm surge that officials had feared.
Still, Milton killed at least 13 people, most of them in the eastern part of Florida. The cleanup from the damage could take weeks or months for some residents, many of whom were still recovering from Hurricane Helene two weeks ago.
Here's what we're covering:
Rising death toll: Officials attributed at least 13 deaths in Florida to the storm. They were killed by tornadoes, falling trees and medical emergencies during the storm, and in cleanup efforts afterward, officials said.
Rescues and recovery: More than 990 people have been rescued since Milton made landfall Wednesday night, officials said. Thousands of rescue workers and National Guard troops were deployed to save people and address flooding and infrastructure damage, including to roads and the drinking water system.
Power outages: More than 2 million customers remained in the dark across Florida as of Friday morning. At one point Thursday, more than 3.4 million were without power, according to the website poweroutage.us. Officials were working to fix power lines and in some places use generators as a temporary measure."
"Our country's flood insurance system requires urgent fixes
October 13, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 15
Author: MARK GONGLOFF","Bloomberg Opinion
There's an old saying that a recession is when you lose your job and a depression is when I lose mine. A similar logic ap-plies to floods. Hurricane Helene brought a flooding disaster to southern Appa-lachia unlike anything seen since Katrina. But getting just an inch of water in your house could be life-changing in its own way.
It shouldn't have to be. A heating planet has made torrential downfalls more common and destructive, meaning Americans every-where must be better prepared for the possibil-ities of catastrophic flood-ing - and not just from storms like Helene or Hurricane Milton. Fixing the country's busted flood insurance system is a good place to start. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which adminis-ters the National Flood Insurance Program, is running out of money after multiple disasters and a quadrupling of prop-erties receiving repeated disaster payouts in the past 20 years.
Helene's destruction puts the insurance problem into stark relief. The storm may
do up to $250 billion in damage and economic loss, according to the latest estimate from the commer-cial forecaster AccuWeath-er. That would make it the second-most destructive storm in history after Katri-na. It's also the deadliest storm since Katrina, taking at least 230 lives so far.
But Standard & Poor's estimates the insured losses from the storm will be just $5 billion to $15 billion. That's a drop in the bucket compared with the $97 billion in profit the insurance industry netted in the first half of the year.
How did insurers get so lucky and homeowners so unlucky? It mostly comes down to flood insurance -or the lack thereof. Less than 2.5% of homes in Helene's path were in-sured against rising wa-ters, Bloomberg News reported. In Buncombe County, North Carolina, where hard-hit Asheville is situated, just 0.7% of homes had flood insur-ance, according to an NBC News estimate.
In fact, only about 4% of all U.S. homeowners have flood insurance, according to FEMA, main-ly through its insurance program. Even in areas at high risk of flooding, less than a third of homes are
insured against rising waters, according to a 2018 estimate by the Wharton School.
Homeowners are taking a lot of risk by passing up on flood insurance. Ac-cording to FEMA, 99% of U.S. counties have flooded at one point or another since 1996, and 40% of its flood claims come from outside of high-risk zones. And all it takes is 1 inch of water in your house to do $25,000 worth of dam-age, the agency suggests.
FEMA's own flood maps are out of date and don't reflect a changing climate. And many others may feel the risk is too low to justi-fy the expense of flood insurance. The median annual cost is less than $800, which feels like a bargain compared with, say, $25,000. Too many people apparently don't see it that way.
""Floods are low-prob-ability but high-conse-quence events,"" Wharton professor Robert Meyer, an expert on both insnr-ance and consumer beha-vior, told me. ""Our brains not well wired to make sensible decisions on that.""
Probably to cope with the bleak harshness of reality, humans have evolved to be both optimistic and amnes-
Making flood insurance cheaper would make it more appealing. And the magic of insurance is that, when more people buy into it, costs fall. Publicly funded national or regional risk pools could be one way to accomplish this.
Overhauling insurance regulation could be another approach. Kenneth Klein, a professor at the California Western School of Law, has suggested that insurers should be forced to include all perils in homeowners' policies. This would lower the costs of insuring against often excluded risks - not just floods, but earthquakes, mold and more - while also keeping all insurers on a level playing field.
FEMA's flood program needs other long-term fixes, which my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Jonathan Levin has listed, including curbing subsidies for wealthy people rebuilding in risky areas. As with so much involving climate change, making some difficult but necessary choices now will prevent far more expensive and painful choices in the future."

Author: CLYDE HUGHES, SHERI WALSH AND DARRYL COOTE","A suspect has been arrested and charged with threatening Federal Emergency Management Agency workers over the weekend that forced the federal agency to pause Hurricane Helene assistance operations in some North Carolina counties.
William Jacob Parsons, 44, of Bostic, N.C., was arrested and charged Saturday with Going Armed to the Terror of the Public, a misdemeanor offense, the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Monday.
Authorities received a report Saturday morning of a white man armed with an assault rifle making comments about ""possibly harming FEMA employees"" working in Lake Lure and Chimney Rock area following Hurricane Helene.
Parsons was identified as a suspect by deputies who connected him to the vehicle associated with the man who uttered the threats.
Authorities said he was armed with a rifle and a handgun when arrested.
He was transported to the Rutherford County Sheriff's Detention Center, and was released on $10,000 bond.
The announcement comes after FEMA announced over the weekend that it had made ""operational changes"" in the area ""based on threat

FEMA officials had their workers in Rutherford County, N.C., leave that jurisdiction immediately on Saturday after the threat was issued by a militia, according to local National Guards troops, The Washington Post reported. The workers, however, returned to process hurricane survivors on Sunday.
FEMA officials said the pause was temporary until they could properly analyze the threats amid a wave of misinformation and disinformation regarding the agency in the wake of the hurricane.
The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office on Mon-

FEMA has been working to help some of the hardest-hit victims of Hurricane Helene in areas where they are not pausing work.
Jordan Monaghan, deputy communications director for North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, said the governor's office was ""aware of significant misinformation online and reports of threats to workers"" in the state.
""The governor has directed the Department of Public Safety to identify with local law enforcement the specific threats and rumors and coordinate with FEMA and other partners to ensure safety and security as this recovery effort continues,"" Monaghan said."
"Tropical storm forecast to hit Florida as major hurricane
September 25, 2024 | Charlotte Observer, The (NC) | Charlotte, North Carolina | Page 6
Author: RICHARD TRIBOU","The storm's breadth means much of the state could face dangerous heavy winds and possible tornado warnings starting Wednesday night with a landfall by Thursday evening. The intensity forecast keeps the system a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph winds and 140 mph gusts in the Gulf of Mexico approaching Florida's coast south of Tallahassee by Thursday afternoon.
BY RICHARD TRIBOU
Orlando Sentinel
ORLANDO, FLA.
Tropical Storm Helene formed Tuesday morning in the Caribbean, and the National Hurricane Center forecasts it to move north and strike Florida as a major Category 3 hurricane on Thursday night.
Earlier Tuesday, the NH C issued hurricane watches for Florida's Gulf Coast and warned storm surge could reach as high as 15 feet near its expected landfall targeting the Big Bend region.
In its 11 a.m. advisory, the system's center was located in the northwest Caribbean Sea about 180 miles east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, and 1780 miles south-southeast of the western tip of Cuba with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph as it moved northwest at 12 mph.
Tropical-storm-force winds extend out 140
miles from its center. Forecasters predict it
will become a hurricane by Wednesday in the Gulf of Mexico and then rapidly intensify into Thursday as it moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The storm's center could target the Big Bend, similar to this year's Hurricane Debby and 2023's Hurricane Idalia, but could also still shift to the east near Tampa or west to the middle of Florida's Panhandle,
""All indications are a significant hurricane impacting the Florida Big Bend, but, and this is a big but, the hazards are going to be well removed from the center and well removed from the cone,"" said NHC Deputy Director Jaime Rhome. ""So I don't want you to look at the cone and say, 'I'm out of the cone/ or 'I'm on the edge of the cone,' because this wind field, the wind field with this system, is going to be really large -larger than you're used to seeing with a traditional hurricane.""
Gov. Ron Desantis issued a state of emergency order Monday for 41 of Florida's 67 counties, and increased that to 61 on Tuesday. He said during a press conference Tuesday morning that the state also asked for pre-landfall declaration from FEMA,
He said the NHC has never in its history had a forecast for a major hurricane for a system that has yet to even form. DeSantis said Florida residents still have time Tuesday and early Wednesday to pre-
pare, fill gas tanks, get water and nonperishable food, clean up yards for potential debris and know evacuation zones.
He said more than 18,000 utility linemen are prepped to respond to expected power outages from the hurricane. There are 3,000 Florida National Guard soldiers ready to assist with post-storm assistance as well as Florida State Guard, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission and county sheriff's office personnel.
Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of
The NHC predicts tropical-storm-force winds could arrive to South Florida by 8 a.m. Wednesday and into Central Florida by 8 p.m.
While the Caribbean system develops, a second system in the far eastern Atlantic also has a high chance to develop into a tropical depression or storm, the NHC stated in its 8 a.m. Tuesday tropical update. The tropical wave located near the Cape Verde Islands is producing more concentrated shower and thunderstorm activity since Monday.
""Environmental conditions appear favorable for gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form in a few days while it moves westward to westnorthwestward across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic,,, forecasters said.
The NHC gives it a 30% chance to develop in the next two days and 80% in the next seven.
After Helene, the next name on the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season list is Isaac."

Helene, a ""catastrophic"" and lethal Category 4 hurricane, slammed into the Big Bend area of the Florida coast Thursday night, packing 140 mph winds, torrential rain, and the threat of life-threatening damage regionwide, the National Hurricane Center reported.
""This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the NHC said. ""Persons should not leave their shelters and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions.''
The hurricane made landfall just after 11 p.m. EDT when the center of the eye reached the shore.
""'People are reminded to not venture out in the relative calm, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly when the eye passes,"" the NHC cautioned.
Such a powerful storm will bring widespread destruction and could result in the loss of life, weather officials said.
Forecasters warned that a potentially deadly storm surge will occur along

portions of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high as 20 feet above ground level. They also warned of destruction from waves, too.
At least a million people regionwide are without power.
Damaging wind gusts will penetrate well inland over portions of Georgia and the Carolinas, they said while warning residents in these regions that they could experience extended power
outages. Additionally, they said,
""considerable to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for northwestern and northern Florida and the southeast through Friday.""
Forecasters also said widespread river flooding is anticipated in a large area affected by the fast-moving storm.
""Weakening is expected after Helene moves inland, but the fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians,"" the forecasters said in a Thursday evening update.
Forecasters also said hurricane-force winds extended outward as far as 60 miles from the center of the storm, while tropical-storm-force winds could be felt as far as 310 miles away. Rain totals could reach 6 inches as far north as Louisville, Ky., the NHC predicted.
Storm surge warnings were in effect for Mexico Beach eastward and southward to Flamingo, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.
The storm surge warning means life-threatening danger from rising water inundation as Helene pushes water inland from the Florida coast.
""This is a life-threatening situation,"" the NHC said. "" Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.
The NHC said Helen is a very large hurricane. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of landfall location and that surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
The NHC said surgerelated flooding will depend on ""the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties ahead of the storm's landfall.
""Florida is preparing for widespread impacts from Hurricane Helene,"" he said.
Normally dry areas near the coast are expected to flood due to the combination of tides and the deadly storm surge, which from Carrabelle to the Suwannee River could reach as high as 20 feet.
The storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall amounts to the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday with strong, damaging winds - especially in gusts - that will penetrate well inland over the southeastern United States, including over higher terrain in the southern Appalachian mountains.
Total rain accumulations into the Appalachians are expected to be 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches."

Mimosa Hills shopping center at the intersection of U.S. Highway 64 bypass and Carbon City Road in Morganton was flooded on Saturday from the Catawba River and remnants of Hurricane Helene.
So many roads were in states of disrepair, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed unless you are traveling for an emergency or to escape danger.
Morganton saw 9. 79 inches of rainfall from Wednesday through Friday, said Doug Outlaw, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Wind speeds were as high as 51 mph in Hickory. In Asheville, Outlaw said wind speeds were as high as 46 mph.
""This will be one of the most significant weather events that happened in the modern eras;' Outlaw said. ""The flooding was compared to Tropical Storm Fred in August of 2021. It's certainly one of the most historically significant storm events that we've ever had!'
With the ground still saturated, Outlaw said the risk of trees fall -ing in the coming days is high. He said it wouldn't take much to topple a tall tree.

Author: STAFF REPORTS","The remnants of Hurricane Helene, a tropical storm by the time it reached North Carolina, hit McDowell County on Friday. The storm brought strong wind, rain and flooding. It knocked out power, cell phone service, internet and water for
most of the county The National Weather Service said
portions of western McDowell County received around 9 inches of rain from Tropical Storm Helene.
The storm initially left nearly all of McDowell County residents without power Saturday. On Sunday, 78% were still without power.
McDowell County's water is limited after the storm, according to emergency management officials. Marion's water supply was expected to be depleted by noon Sunday, and Old Fort has limited to not water as of Saturday evening. Marion's water intakes were without power or were not producing water, according to a Saturday news release from McDowell County Emergency Management. The city is working with Duke Energy to restore power to the Buck Creek water intake, but it may take time, the release said.
Without power, the water supply in Marion was expected to run out, the release said.
""It is urgent that all city of Marion and McDowell County water custo1ners conserve water to the greatest possible degree in order to extend the city and county water supplies;' the release said.
Non- essential water use was prohibited.
Old Fort's water system was impacted by flooding as well, leaving the city with little to no water, a Saturday emergency management update said.
The county is still working to rescue people who are trapped and missing, emergency management said.
Distribution centers
McDowell County opened distribution centers for food and water and a third shelter on Sunday.
The distribution centers are located at: ? Woodlawn: Hicks Chapel
Church, 6008 U.S. Hwy. 221 N ? North Cove: North Cove Elementary, 8153 U.S. Hwy. 221 N Emergency management said
this is the first of many distribution centers.
""Since the early morning hours, McDowell County Emergency Services has been working tirelessly to set up Points of Distribution across the county to provide critical supplies, including food and water, to every community,"" emergency management said in the release. ""Our dedicated team will not stop until all citizens have access to the resources they need for their safety and well -being. We are working around the clock, doing everything we can to bring resources into McDowell County as quickly as possible.
The county has opened a third shelter at the YMCA in Marion on Sunday, emergency management said in a release. The county had three shelters as of Sunday afternoon: Church-155 Glenwood Church Rd., Marion. ? Senior Center in Marion-100 Spaulding Rd., Marion. ? YMCA of Marion, 348 Grace
Corpening Dr., Marion. (Opening Sunday night at 7 p.m.)
There is no shelter in Old Fort, the county said.
Information was linrited about the impact the storm had on Old Fort.
Calls for help
McDowell County 911 received over 760 calls for service during this storm on Friday, according to McDowell County Emergency
Management. Even in the days after, McDowell County 911 got hundreds of calls for help every hour, emergency management said. The calls involve patients who are trapped with severe trauma and running out of oxygen or essential medical supplies, the county said.
It took time for emergency management to respond, because multiple areas in McDowell were inaccessible to emergency personnel in the days after the storm, emergency management said.
""Mutual aid agencies fron1 all across North Carolina are assisting McDowell County respond to this disaster;' the county said Friday. ""A mass casualty bus, multiple out-of-county ambulances, National Guard personnel, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, swift water rescue teams and state law enforcement are supporting local fire, rescue, EMS, and law enforcement. Heavy construction equipment is also being used to access several critical incidents!'
In some areas, responders could not reach those in help because of landslides, downed trees, power lines and flooded roads, the Saturday release said. By Sunday, water was starting to recede and some of the Catawba River was back at bank level, an alert from McDowell County Emergency Management said. But the county said there is still standing water around the county.
With the water receding, rescue efforts shifted from swift water rescue to urban search and rescue, the Sunday alert said.
More than 20 air rescues were conducted Saturday to extract people from isolated areas, emergency management said.
The biggest challenges in emergency response were road blockages, fuel supply shortages for emergency vehicles, difficulty communicating with little to no cell and radio service and delivery of food and water, the county said.
Responders worked to deliver supplies like food and water throughout McDowell County, emergency management said. The supplies were distributed to drop points by the U.S. National Guard, the county said.

The local sports scene is no different as many facilities fron1 local recreational leagues to high school fields also have taken significant damage from the flooding with Helene. Burke and McDowell counties were hit very hard over a three-day period with rain in excess of 20 inches that fell along the area, according to the National Weather Service. The rain led to rapid rises of water all along the Catawba River.
In McDowell County, the most significant sports damage is focused on ball fields operated by the McDowell County Parks and Recreation. As of Sunday afternoon, more of the damage is becoming realized. The North Fork of the Catawba River widened as the storm peaked on Friday and brought a lot of damage into the valley in the Ashford and North Cove communities.
Sandy Andrews Park is one of the locations in North Cove that received extensive damage from the rapids that developed as the North Fork reached major flood stage on Friday. Other facilities owned by McDowell Parks and Recreation that may have been damaged include Lindley Park in Old Fort, which lies a matter of yards from the Catawba River. As the recovery efforts continue over the next few days, additional issues will likely be realized as we learn more about the true scope of the flooding.
Another area that was heavily inlpacted includes the practice and baseball fields at West McDowell Middle School due to the Catawba River's expansive reach.
According to U.S. Geological Survey data, the Catawba River at Pleasant Gardens had a record high crest of 21.6 6 feet Friday afternoon, nearly four feet above the previous record crest that occurred in 2004. That all results in several feet of water covering the practice football field and baseball field for the school. With the water now gone, all the debris and a muddy mess is left behind.
McDowell High School's athletic facilities as of Sunday has appeared to fare in better shape. The school, which is located on a ridge, was well away from the floodwaters. More will be known about the status of the high school fields once members of the school and athletic department can safely get out and inspect things.

"Crew still working to restore power

SHARON MCBRAYER smcbrayer@morganton.com","While around 13,000 Duke Energy customers in Burke County remained without power Tuesday morning, company representatives say multiple crews were working to get power restored to the county.
Jeff Brooks, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said he was driving through Burke County on Mon -day and saw downed trees everywhere, miles of downed power lines and a lot of broken power poles.
'So some of those were in hard-to-access areas, so those will be the kind of challenges that they're working to restore:' Brooks said. He said the company expects the majority of customers will have power by Friday evening.
Most power will be restored much sooner than that, he said.
He said on Monday evening that 18,000 line and tree workers were working in western North Caro lina and Upstate South Carolina, and more were on the way.
Restoring power to lines that have been downed by trees is a multi-stage process, Brooks said.
He said it first requires a tree crew to remove all the trees from the lines and then install new poles and new equipment.
Duke Energy typically restores power from some of the main transmission lines to bring power to the region, and then crews work to restore emergency services' power first, including fire departments, hospitals and police departments. Crews then work to restore as many customers as possible with each restoration, meaning outages on a line that has the largest number of customers get repaired first, Brooks said.
""Sometimes the scope of the damage requires more resources, and that may cause us to move to a different one first, but that's generally the process to follow as we're working to restore power"" Brooks said. He said it's encouraging to see more roads opening up, which means Duke Energy workers will be able to get crews into more areas.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during this time;' Brooks said. ""We know that this is a challenging time for many people and that being without power is not only inconvenient, but that it removes some security that we have when we have power available. So, we're working really hard!'
Brooks said Duke Energy crew members live and work in the area as well and many of them are dealing with the same situations at home that its customers are, but they're all working to get power back up for everybody.
""This is, certainly in my 17 years of working storms, this is one of the worst I've ever seen;' Brooks said. ""And I think given the terrain in the foothills and the mountains, it makes that work even more challenging. But we continue to bring in resources to help, and
we'll keep at it until we get everybody back up:'
On Tuesday, the city of Morganton said its electric crews were working on OldN.C. Highway 18, Mount Horne Church Road, Dale Circle off of Enola Road, Willowbrook Drive and Alexander Avenue.
""We will try to keep you updated with new locations when we are told,"" the city said. 11We understand that your neighbor may have power, but dne to the nature of the circuits you may still be without power. Please be patient as we continue to make repairs.""
Boil water advisory in Morganton
As for water use, the city of Morganton said on Tuesday the boil water advisory has been lifted for the areas served by the Valdese Avenue, Dale Circle, Astro Drive and the Salem water tanks. It said water tests have confirmed that the water is safe in those areas.

JEFF AMY AND JOHN SEEWER Associated Press
PENSACOLA, N.C. - Rescue crews and volunteers facing obstacles at every turn in North Carolina's remote mountains paddled canoes across swollen rivers and steered horses past mudslides in the rush to reach those stranded or missing after Hurricane Helene's rampage that killed more than 200 throughout the Southeast.
Now a week since the storm first roared onto Florida's Gulf Coast, the search continued for people who have yet to be heard from in places where phone service and electricity were knocked out. Pleas for help came from people running low on medicine or in need of fuel for their generators.
How many people are missing or un -accounted for isn't clear. The death toll grew to 215 people on Thursday as more victinls were found, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. About half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in South Carolina and Georgia.
Along the Cane River in western North Carolina's Blue Ridge mountains, rescuers from the Pensacola Volunteer Fire Department cut their way through trees at the top of a valley where a wall of water swept through for hours last week.
Pensacola, which sits a few miles from Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the Mississippi River, lost an untold number of people, said Mark Harrison, chief medical officer for the department. ""We're starting to do recovery:"" he said
Thursday. ""We've got the most critical people out!""
Harrison helped dispatch volunteers driving all-terrain vehicles on supply runs to people still on ridgetops. Many don't want to leave their houses, while others lost their vehicles and need help getting to town."

ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI - A storm system that was brewing in the Gulf of Mexico strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton on Saturday, and forecasters warned it could intensify into a hurricane and slam into the west coast of Florida this week.
Tropical Storm Milton was about 220 miles north-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in an afternoon advisory. It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 35 counties ahead of the storm's potential landfall. Since many of those counties are still recovering
from Hurricane Helene, he asked the Florida Division of E1nergency Management and the Florida Depart1nent of Transportation to coordinate all available resources and personnel to supplement local communities as they expedite debris removal.
Though no coastal watches or warnings were in effect, the hurricane center said the Florida Pen -insula, the Florida Keys, Mexico 1s Yucatan peninsula and the north -western Bahainas should monitor the system's progress.
The storm is forecast to strengthen and bring the risk of life-threatening impacts to parts of Florida, with hurricane and storm- surge watches likely in effect from Sunday. Parts of the state were expected to have heavy rainfall beginning that day, threatening flooding.
'There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Perrinsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast;' the center said.
Looking further east, Leslie strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean but isn't threatening land, forecasters said. The storm was located Saturday about 725 miles west-southwest of the southernmost Caba Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
Meanwhile, Hurricane Kirk remained a Category 4 storm, and waves from the system were affecting the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Anti! -Jes, forecasters said. The storm's swells were expected to spread to the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the Bahamas on Saturday night and Sunday.
Forecasters warned the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Kirk was expected to weaken starting Saturday, the center said.
Though there were no coastal warnings or watches in effect for Kirk, the center said those in the Azores, where swells could hit Monday, should monitor the storm's progress. Kirk was about 975 miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph.
The storms churned as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast searched for people unaccounted for more than a week after Hurricane Helene. The death toll from that storm inched up to 227 on Saturday."

FREIDA FRISARD Associated Press
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -Hurricane Milton quickly intensified Sunday and is on track to become a major hurricane with the Tampa Bay area in its sights, putting Florida on edge and triggering evacuation orders along a coast still reeling from Helene's devastation.
While forecast models vary, the most likely path suggests Milton could make landfall Wednesday in the Tampa Bay area and remain a hurricane as it moves across central Florida into the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said. That would largely spare other southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian Mountains, with a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 130 people.
Florida Gov. Ron De Santis said Sunday that it's clear that Florida is going to be hit hard by Milton - ""I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point.""
Also on Sunday, the U.S. government's top disaster relief official said that false clain1s and conspiracy theories about the federal response to Hurricane Helene - spread most prominently by Donald Trump - are ""demoralizing"" aid workers and creating fear in people who need recovery assistance.
""It's frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people: said Deanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""It's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state: she said, referring to North Carolina.
Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.
Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.
Hurricane Milton was centered about 815 miles west-southwest of Tampa on Sunday afternoon, with maximu1n sustained winds of 80 mph, tbe National Hurricane Center said.
""You have time to prepare - all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,"" the governor said. ""If you're on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you'll be asked to leave:
In Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, officials issued voluntary evacuation orders for people along the barrier island beaches and mobile home parks. Mandatory evacuations are likely to follow.
With Milton achieving hurricane status, this is the first time the Atlantic has had three simultaneous hurricanes after September, said Colorado State University hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach."

Associated Press
Hurricanes are humanity's reminder of the uncontrollable, chaotic power of Earth's weather.
Milton's powerful push toward Florida just days after Helene devastated large parts of the Southeast likely has some in the region wondering if they are being targeted. In some corners of the Internet, Helene has already sparked conspiracy theories and disinformation suggesting the government somehow aimed the hurricane at Republican voters. Besides discounting common sense, such theories disregard weather history that shows the hurricanes are hitting many of the same areas they have for centuries. They also presume an ability for humans lo quickly reshape the weather far beyond relatively puny efforts such as cloud seeding.
""If meteorologists could stop hurri -canes, we would stop hurricanes:' Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.
""If we could control the weather, we would not want the kind of death and destruction that's happened."" A fully developed hurricane releases heat energy that is the equivalent of a IO-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes -more than all the energy used at a given time by humanity, according to National Hurricane Center tropical analysis chief Chris Landsea.
And scientists are now finding many ways climate change is making hurricanes worse, with warmer oceans that add energy and more water in the warming atmosphere to fall as rain, said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""The amount of energy a hurricane generates is insane:' said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. It's the height of human arrogance to think people have the power to change them, he said.
But that hasn't stopped people from trying, or at least thinking about trying.
Jim Fleming of Colby College has studied historical efforts to control the weather and thinks humans have nowhere near the practical technology to get there. He described an attempt in 194 7 in which General Electric partnered with the U.S. military to drop dry ice from Air Force jets into the path of a hurricane in an attempt to weaken it. It didn't work.
""The typical science goes like understanding, prediction and then possibly control;' Fleming said, noting that the atmosphere is far more powerful and complex than most proposals to control it. ""It goes back into Greek mythol -ogy to think you can control the powers of the heavens, but also it's a failed idea.""
In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the federal government briefly tried Project STORMFURY. The idea was to seed a hurricane to replace its eyewall with a larger one that would make the storm bigger in size but weaker in intensity. Tests were inconclusive and researchers realized if they made the storm larger, people who wouldn't have been hurt by the storm would now be in danger, which is an ethical and liability problem, the project director once said.
For decades, the National Hurricane Center and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have been asked about nuclear-bombing a hurricane. But the bombs aren't powerful enough, and it would add the problem of radioactive fallout, Corbosiero said.
Bringing cooling icebergs or seeding or adding water-absorbing substances also are ideas that just don't work, NOAA scientists said.
Failed historical attempts to control hurricanes differ somewhat from some scientists' futuristic ideas to combat climate change and extreme weather. That's because instead of targeting individual weather events, modern geoengineers would operate on a larger scale - thinking about how to reverse the broadscale damage humans have al -ready done to the global climate by emitting greenhouse gases.
Scientists in the field say one of the most promising ideas they see based on computer models is solar geoengineering. The method would involve lofting aerosol particles into the upper atmosphere to bounce a tiny bit of sunlight back into space, cooling the planet slightly."

TAMPA, Fla. - Fearful Florida residents streamed out of the Tampa Bay region Tuesday ahead of what could be a once-in-a-century direct hit from Hurricane Milton, as crews worked furiously to prevent furniture, appliances and other waterlogged wreckage from the last big storm from becoming deadly projectiles in this one.
The preparations marked the last chance for millions of people in the Tampa metro area to prepare for lethal storm surges, ferocious winds and possible tornadoes in a place that has narrowly avoided a head-on blow from a major storm for generations.
""Today's the last day to get ready;' said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA director who previously ran the state's emergency operation division. ""This is bringing everything: 1
Gov. RonDeSantis said the state deployed more than 300 dump trucks that removed 1,300 loads of debris left behind by Hurricane Helene by Tuesday afternoon.
After weakening slightly, Milton regained strength Tuesday afternoon and became a Category 5 storm again. It could make landfall Wednesday night in the Tampa Bay area, which has a population of more than 3.3 million people. The
II Florida counties under mandatory evacuation orders are home to about 5.9 million people, according to population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Those who defy the orders are on their own, and first responders are not expected to risk their lives to rescue them at the height of the storm.
Tampa Bay has not been hit directly by a major hurricane since 1921, and authorities fear its luck is about to run out. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor issued increasingly dire warnings, noting that a 15-foot surge could swallow an entire house.
""So if you're in it, basically that's the coffin that you're in;' she said.
Milton's forecast trajectory wobbled slightly Tuesday, meaning it could make landfall in less populated areas south of Tampa Bay, according to the National Hurricane Center. Still, the whole region is expected to get slammed by the storm.
Milton is forecast to cross central Florida and to dump as much as 18 inches of rain while heading toward the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Hurricane Center. That path would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Carolinas.
The arrival of back-to-back hurricanes that rapidly intensified into mighty storms comes as climate change exacerbates conditions that are allowing then1 to thrive in warming waters."

EDITOR'S NOTE: On Football analyzes the biggest topics in the NFL from week to week.
Robert Saleh got to coach just five full games with Aaron Rod -gers before New York Jets owner Woody Johnson decided to 1nake a change.
Johnson fired Saleh on Tuesday in a desperate effort to reinvigorate a talented 2-3 team that has underachieved, especially on offense where Rodgers and coordinator Nathaniel Hackett have struggled to duplicate the success they had in Green Bay.
New York's offense is 25th in points (18.6) per game and 27th in yards (286.6). The defense is fifth in points (17.0) allowed and second in yards (255.8).
But Johnson couldn't fire Hackett - that probably wouldn't sit well with Rodgers - so Saleh is out and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich takes over as interim coach for a team that's trying to end the NFL's longest active playoff drought at 13 seasons.
Only the 2021 Raiders with Rich Bisaccia and the 1961 Oilers with Wally Lemm made the playoffs after switching coaches during the season.
But the Jets aren't on the verge of rebuilding. They were two plays away from being 4- I.
If Greg Zuerlein made a SO-yard field goal in the final minute of a 10-9 loss to Denver in Week4and Rodgers hadn't thrown a terrible pick-6 in a 23-17 loss to Minne
sota on Sunday, it would be a different vibe in New York.
The Jets have a stout defense that would be even better if they could get edge rusher Haason Red -dick to end his holdout. They just need Rodgers and an offense that also features wide receivers Garrett Wilson and Mike Williams, and running backs Breece Hall and Braelon Allen to get going.
A victory on Monday night at home against Buffalo (3-2) gives the Jets a share of first place in the AFC East.
Saleh isn't getting a chance to finish what he started, however. He moves on after going 20-36, mostly with mediocre quarter backs.
Saleh finished 3-3 with Rodgers, including a win in the season opener last year in which the fourtime NFL MVP tore an Achilles tendon on the fourth snap.
He was 12-21 with Zach Wilson, 1-4 with Joe Fiacco, 2-5 with Mike White, 2-1 with Trevor Siemian and 0- 2 with Tim Boyle.
Oh, he was 1-0 in games that include awkward sideline hugs and 0-1 following a cadence controversy.
Hurricane prep. 
The NFL and FEMA entered into a strategic partnership last month, designating several NFL stadiums, including Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, as mission-capable venues that can be used during e1nergency response and recovery efforts.
With Hurricane Milton set to hit Tampa Bay, Raymond James Stadium has been bringing in first responders since Saturday and will have approximately 1,000 of them and other staff to support throughout the storm and ready to deploy after it passes. The sta -dium was also used for Hurricanes Helene and Ian.
Pittsburgh's Acrisure Stadium, Seattle's Lumen Field, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium along with the Buccaneers' home are the designated stadi -urns.
These venues can be used for staging areas (first responders, electrical trucks, etc.), commodity distribution (water, food, blankets, sandbags, etc.), disaster recovery centers where people can come and sign up for loans, etc. They are not designed to shelter citizens.
""Stadiums are valuable com -munity assets that are often used in times of disasters,'' NFL chief security officer Cathy Lanier said. ""This designation reflects the role that many stadiums play, not only on Sundays, but especially in times of need. We are proud to work with FEMA and first responders at the local and state level to ensure disaster response agencies have the information and tools they need to help a community recover when disaster strikes."""

","Hurricane Milton spawns tornadoes, l(ills at least 8 people
Associated Press
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Hundreds of Florida residents were rescued Thursday from the aftermath of Hurricane Milton after the storm smashed through coastal communities where it tore homes into pieces, filled streets with mud and spawned a barrage of tornadoes that killed at least eight.
Arriving just two weeks after the misery wrought by Hurricane Helene, Milton also knocked out power to more than 3 million customers, flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off a baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.
But many people also expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse. The hurricane spared Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never 1naterialized.
The storm tracked to the south in the final hours and made landfall late Wednesday as a Category 3 hurricane in Siesta Key, about 70 1niles south of Tampa. Dan1age was widespread, and water levels could continue to rise for days, but Gov. Ron Desantis said it was not ""the worst-case scenario!
The worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet - lower than in the worst place during Helene.
Milton also dumped up to 18 inches of rain in s01ne areas.
At least 340 individuals and 49 pets were saved in ongoing search -and-rescue operations, Desantis said Thursday afternoon.
Officials in the hard -hit Florida counties of Hillsborough, Pinellas, Sarasota and Lee urged people to stay home, warning of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding.
Just inland from Tampa, the flooding in Plant City was ""absolutely staggering;' according to City Manager Bill McDaniel, who estimated the city received 13.5 inches of rain.
The tiny barrier island of Mat -lacha, just off Fort Myers, got hit by both a tornado and a surge, with many of the colorful buildings in the fishing and tourist vii -!age sustaining serious damage.
In contrast, city workers on Anna Maria Island were grateful not to be wading through floodwaters as they picked up debris Thursday morning, two weeks after Helene battered buildings and blew in piles of sand up to 6 feet tall.
Power was knocked out across much of the state, with more than 3.4 million homes and businesses without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.
The fabric that serves as the roof of Tropicana Field - home of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team in St. Petersburg - was ripped to shreds by fierce winds. Debris littered the field, but no injuries were reported."

October 16, 2024 | News Herald, The (Morganton, NC) | Morganton, North Carolina | Page 1
Author: JAMES POLLARD Associated Press","NEW YORK - Former President Donald Tru1np's campaign is using GoFundMe to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene's destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief.
The two high-profile fundraisers - organized by the Republican nominee's national finance director - have drawn more than $14 inillion.
They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts. Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds 
for its own political ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson said that the majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed.
But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party's presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company - which usually features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical bills - to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes.
""It's pretty unusual and actually quite odd;' said Brett Kappel, a longtime cam -paign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised both Republicans and Democrats."
"Slower Growth in Holiday Sales?
October 19, 2024 | News Herald, The (Morganton, NC) | Morganton, North Carolina | Page 21
Author: ANNE D'INNOCENZIO Associated Press","NEW YORK - The largest retail trade group in the United States says that it expects con -sumers to spend more during the upcoming holiday shopping season but that the growth in sales will be slower than last year due to concerns over persistent inflation and prices.
The National Retail Federation said its 2024 forecast indicates that shoppers will make $979.5 billion to $989 billion worth of purchases in November and December, which would represent a 2.5% to 3.5% increase over the same two-month period a year ago.
However, the $955.6 billion spent during the 2023 holiday shopping season was 3.9% more than in 2022.
This year's predicted pace is consistent with the average increase of 3.6% from 2010 to 2019. During the coronavirus pandemic, Americans ramped up their spending. Holiday season sales rose 9% in 2020 from the year before, and they soared 12.4% in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation,
The trade group makes its calculations based on government figures. The numbers exclude sales at automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants.
The forecast considers economic indicators such as employment, wages, consumer confidence, disposable income, consumer credit, previous retail sales and weather.
""Interest rates are still a little higher than they were in recent memory;National Retail Federation CEO and President Matt Shay said during a call with reporters. uconsumers do have those interest rates and the Jin -gering inflation on their minds. So we expect that consumers will continue to be more price-conscious and pragmatic in their spending decisions.""
The retail federation issued its look-ahead Tuesday as the data shows U.S. consumers continuing to spend, powered by sturdy hiring, low unemployment and healthy household finances,
Moreover, gas prices are coming down, leaving a little extra money for shoppers to spend on gifts. The national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline was $3.20 on Tuesday; a year ago, it was $3.60, according to auto club AAA.
But there are plenty of cha! -lenges this season, including a presidential election that could create a big distraction from shopping in November. NRF officials said it was nearly impossible to measure the election's impact
on current or future spending, With Thanksgiving falling on Nov. 28, there also will be six fewer days between the holiday and Christmas Day compared to last year. Other factors that could hurt holiday sales: the economic impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton, NRF officials said.
Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, plans to advertise savings on Thanksgiving meal products starting Oct.14, about two weeks earlier than last year.
NRF's forecast was in line with the predictions of other analysts, which also point to a more restrained mood among shoppers.
Management consulting firm Bain & Co. said it anticipated November and December retail sales to rise by 3% as opposed to the 4.2% growth seen last year. AlixPartners, another consulting firm, expects sales for October through December to be up anywhere from 2% to 5%, lower than last year's 6% increase. Consulting and research firm Customer Growth Partners predicted sales to grow 4% during the holiday period, just slightly below its figure from last year.
Meanwhile, Adobe Analytics predicts online sales will surge 8.9%, marking the highest spending pace since 2021 when it was 8.6%, A year ago, online sales were up 4.9%, compared with the previous year. Vivek Pan -dya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights, noted that shoppers' bigger interest in discounts will drive spending. Discounts should average about 30%, the same as a year ago, he said.
While the inflation rate is coming down, it's still a big pocketbook issue for shoppers as many food items still cost considerably more than they did a few years ago.
fames Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, thinks shoppers are even more price-conscious than they were last year when it comes to buying toys. Toys under $20 are resonating with parents, he said.
Kohl's executives said last week that shoppers, particularly those in lower income brackets, will feel more squeezed than a year ago,
Christie Raymond, Kohl's chief marketing officer, said the cumulative impact of high prices on food and other essentials is eating into people's savings. As part of its holiday strategy, Kohl's plans to be aggressive with offering discounts. As for the presidential race, Kohl's executives said they were not sure if consumers will hold back their buying ahead of the Nov. 5 election but it's something they are monitoring.
""We're just trying to follow the consumer, and we know that they're going to feel squeezed once that Thanksgiving time frame hit; Raymond told reporters."

Author: TAMMY WILSON","I never lost power during Hurricane Helene.
When friends and family called me about the hurricane, I had to tell them I was extremely lucky.
The storm was bad. A lot of North Carolinians lost family and friends, their home, their cherished belongings, their pets. Some saw their real estate literally washed away.
But I can't claim any of those stories. I've tried to imagine the terror of seeing a wall of water crashing toward me,
sweeping away my home and neighbors, pets, virtually everything I own.
Being a near miss - or even a far miss - leaves its mark. Last week a Face-
booker from Louisiana said she understood. She lived through Katrina, and could relate to the relief of being spared, but, at the same time, the overwhelming feeling of anxiety, numbness and profound sadness.
That's how it is with trauma. It takes different forms, and in one way or another, we've all been traumatized by being so close to destruction. In the end, I don't know why we were spared and why the folks west of here were not.
Perhaps TV's Mister Rogers responded best when he explained disasters in a way kids could understand. When there are scary things in the news, he said, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping: In the wake of Helene, ordinary people dropped everything to come to North Carolina's rescue. Men and women, young and old, helped turn Hickory into a hub of hope. Private pilots, many of them ex-military, arrived with their helicopters to make air drops to hard - rut areas. Community members rallied to organize places to bring necessary supplies and cash to support the effort.
On my way to the collection point ir1 the parking lot of Appalachian State University in Hickory, I found myself behind a horse trailer and a flatbed. On the flatbed was a generator and power tools. In the trailer were cases of bottled water, packages of diapers, toilet paper and more. Obviously, he was on a relief mission. Had I not been caught by a traffic light I would have given the driver a thumbs up.
Surely Helene will be one of those ca -!amities by which we mark time. Two days after Helene's wretched visit, I opened 1ny T-shirt drawer to see, neatly folded, my shirt from Lake Lure. I remember the day I bought it. Cousin Renee was visiting from Illinois and wanted to see where ""The Last of the Mahicans'' was filmed, She's a Daniel Day-Lewis fan and wanted to tour the fa -mous waterfall.
We enjoyed a sandwich lunch, poked around the Lake Lure Inn, and browsed the gift shop.
Later, we took the boat ride of the lake with its narration of how the lake was formed in Hickory Nut Gorge into a place where ""summer"" is a verb. The Morse family, who founded Carolina Mountain Power Corn -pany, paid to build a dam on the Broad River to create the lake back in 1927.
Our boat captain indulged us in movie lore, too, including spots used to shoot ""Dirty Dancing;the film that made stars of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. We drifted past Firefly Cove and the stone steps where Jennifer Grey practiced her dance steps in cutoff shorts.
It's not that I have spent that much time at Lake Lure, but I've made enough visits to envy those who have. It had cottagey surroundings, stunning views, and laid -back ambiance. It was a place lost in time, a poignant reminder of a time and place that's been erased.
Lake Lure sprouted up as a tourist attraction with a striped awning vibe. The affluent built lakeside cottages with screened porches and walls of windows. They pondered the looking glass water and lore about the outline of the mountain ridge that looks like a sleeping lady.
My first visit to Lake Lure was about 30 years ago, when 
I attended a conference at the Inn. I remember imagining how the hotel would have appeared during the Gatsby era. In fact, Gatsby's creator, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and wife Zelda stayed there back in the day.
A recent attraction was the Flowering Bridge. When it became known that the state would decommission the 1925 bridge, a group of citizens with green thumbs urged the structure to be saved and used as a garden space. They called it the Flowering Bridge. They say it attracted as many as 18,000 visitors a year.
Two years ago, the garden was expanded for pet owners and their furry friends to snatch a chewable from the Doggie Stick Library and enjoy a drink of water. Pet owners, wracked in grief, would visit the Rainbow Bridge, and pay tribute to departed pets, placing collars on the bannisters. People came from far and wide to memorialize pets that had passed on.
No one could imagine that a monster storm could churn its way northward and demolish the Flower Bridge, much less Lake Lure itself."
"Florida digs out from mountains of sand swept in by Helene, Milton
October 20, 2024 | News Herald, The (Morganton, NC) | Morganton, North Carolina | Page 1

BRADENTON BEACH, Fla. - When a hurricane sets its sights on Florida, storm -weary residents may trunk of catastrophic wind, hammering rain and dangerous storn1 surge. Mounds of sand swallowing their homes? Not so much.
or higher. The fine, white sand helps make Florida's beaches among the best in the world. But the powerful storms have turned the precious commodity into a costly nuisance, with sand creating literal barriers to recovery.
""I've never seen sand like this:' said Scott Bennett, a contractor who has worked in storm recovery since 2005's Hurricane Katrina. ""Wind, rain, water, but never sand!'
The morning after Hurricane Milton crashed ashore, the roads of Bradenton Beach, about an hour's drive south of Tampa, were lined with sandbanks a couple of feet high, surrounding son1e bungalows. The views of the Old Florida beach town were not unlike those after a blustery Midwestern blizzard.
""The best way to describe it, it's like getting 4 to 6 feet of snow up north,' 1 said Jeremi Roberts, a member of the State Emergency Response Team surveying the damage that day.
Another hour south, Ron and Jean Dyer said the storms blew about 3 feet of sand up against their condo building on Venice Island.
""The beach just moved over everything; Ron Dyer said.
It had taken dozens of volunteers ar1ned with shovels and wheelbarrows two days to dig all the sand out of the condo's pool after Hurricane Helene, only to see Milton fill it back in, he said.
""They just kept digging and wheeling and digging and wheel -ing .... They were there for two days doing that;' he said. ""We got to do it all over again!'
Storm recovery contractor Larry West estimates that his team will do about $300,000 worth of work just to clean up all the sand and debris left behind at one of the condo buildings he's restoring in Manasota Key, about 35 miles south of Sarasota. He expects many property own -ers, especially those who don't have flood insurance, will have to pay out of pocket for this kind of cleanup,
""The poor hon1eowner who's going to have to spend $150,000 cleaning up, that's going to hurt them hard;' West said.
West said he is not sure where to take the sand after he heard that a local park that Charlotte County officials designated as a drop-off site was filling up with the stuff. According to the county, two sites remain open for dropping off sand.
""Right now I'm building mountains in their parking area;' West said of the condo complex he's restoring. ""We're just kind of waiting to find out if they're gonna have us transport it to a different location!'
Officials in hard- hit Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, are still crunching the numbers on just how big of a bite Helene and Milton took out of the coastline there, but county Public Works director Kelli Hammer Levy puts the current estimate at I million cubic yards of sand lost.
""A lot of volume has been lost, and that's our main concern here, right now;' she told the county's Tourism Development Council. ""It's hard to kind of stay positive with some of this stuff. I know the pictures are not what we want to see:'
For perspective, a 2018 beach renourishment project to shore up the county's coastline with 1.3 million cubic yards of sand cost more than $50 million, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Levy is hopeful that much of the displaced sand can be repurposed. Pinellas officials are encouraging residents to cart their sand right back out onto the beach - as long as it's clean.
''Again, we just need to remove debris. I've seen some piles out there with kitchen cabinets in it:' Levy said. ""We're going to have a problem if we have a lot of that stuff out there!'
The county has also opened a drop-off location where residents can leave sand for workers to screen and clean, or dispose of if it's contaminated, under guid -ance from the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
In the meantime, Florida resi -dents are continuing to dig out of the storm-driven sand, many of them by hand.
""Every shovelful is heavy;' said West, the construction contractor. ""This is horrendous, as far as the cleanup."""

UNITED NATIONS - President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all - out war and Israel's bloody operation against Barnas in Gaza neared the one-year mark.
Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression.
His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if forn1er President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Ka -mala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future.
""I've seen a remarkable sweep of history/' Eiden said. ""I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not!'
""We are stronger than we think"" when the world acts together, he added.
1'Full scale war is not in anyone's interest,"" Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace.
Meanwhile, the head of the UN warned the gathered leaders of nations Tuesday that impunity, inequality and uncertainty are driving modern civilization toward ""a powder keg that risks engulfing the world"" - the latest in an increasing number of clarion calls from Antonio Guterres in recent years that the global situation is becoming intolerable and unsustainable.

He said the world is in ""an era of epic transformation 11 facing challenges never seen before, with geopolitical divisions deepening, the planet heating and wars raging in the Middle East, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere with no clue how they will end.
""We are edging towards the unimaginable - a powder keg that risks engulfing the world;' Guterres told presidents, prime ministers and ministers in the vast General Assembly hall.
But he stopped short of saying hope was gone. ""The challenges we face,"" he said, ""are solvable."""

Tornadoes are a possibility from the storm, but Chaney said they are not the main threat. He said ""a couple of tornadoes"" are expected for the area.
Chaney said most of the rain and wind is expected to move out of the area by around noon Friday.

Associated Press
PERRY, Fla. -The U,S, Southeast grappled Sunday with rising death tolls, a lack of vital supplies in isolated, flood-stricken areas and the widespread loss of homes and property while the devastating toll of Hurricane Helene became more clear and officials warned of a lengthy and difficult rebuild.
A North Carolina County that includes the mountain city of Asheville reported 30 people killed due to the storm, pushing the overall death toll to at least 84 people across several states.
Supplies were being airlifted to the region around Asheville. Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder pledged that she would have food and water into the city - which is known for its arts, cul -ture and natural attractions - by Monday.
""We hear you, We need food and we need water;i Pinder said on a Sunday call with reporters, ""My staff has been making every request possible to the state for support and we've been working with every single organization that has reached out. What I promise you is that we are very close!'
The storm upended life throughout the Southeast. Deaths also were reported in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia.
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding,
He implored residents in western North Carolina to avoid travel, both for their own safety and to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. More than 50 search teams spread throughout the region in search of stranded people.
One rescue effort involved saving 41 people north of Asheville, Another mission focused on saving a single infant. The teams found people through both 911 calls and social media messages, North Carolina National Guard Adjutant General Todd Hunt said.
Hurricane Helene roared ashore late Thursday in Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph winds. A weakened Helene quickly moved through Georgia, then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains that flooded creeks and rivers and strained dams,
There have been hundreds of water rescues, including in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee,
where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday.
Several million were still without power Sunday afternoon.
The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 2 feet of rain from Tuesday through Saturday,
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said the federal disaster agency was actively engaged across six states, meeting the requests of governors and state level responders, She noted the Appalachian regions across North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia presented particular concerns. Criswell toured south Georgia on Sunday and planned to be in North Carolina on Monday,
""It's still very much an active search and rescue mission"" in western North Carolina, Criswell said."

Author: PAUL NEWBERRY Associated Press","ATLANTA - The final two games of a crucial series between the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves were postponed Wednesday by heavy rains ahead of Hurricane Helene.
Now, a wild card race that seemed headed to the final day of the regular season may require an extra day, And a doubleheader, at that,
The regular season was set to end Sunday, but the Mets are now scheduled to return to Atlanta on Monday for a pair of games 40 minutes apart that could determine who heads to the playoffs,
New York plays three games in Milwaukee against the National League Central-champion Brewers beginning late Friday, while the Braves have a weekend series against the Kansas
City Royals, a playoff contender in the American League,
jjWe've got to move on to the next series now:' Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. 11We're facing another really good team in Milwaukee and we've got to go out there and not only win a series, but we've got to go out there and take care of business. That's the only thing we can do, control the things we control?'
The Mets (87-70) went into the day with a halfgame lead over Arizona in the wild card race, with the Braves (86-71) a full game back, Two of those teams will make the playoffs, which are set to begin Tuesday with the best-of-three wild card round,
""I hope the Royals can get here;i said Braves manager Brian Snitker, looking ahead to an 01ninous forecast for the next two days as the hurricane's remnants move through Georgia, ""I would hope we don't get things screwed up for their series?'
The Diamondbacks had a game Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. Arizona was off Thursday before a three game series at home against the San Diego Padres to close out the regular season,
The Braves beat the Mets 5-1 on Tuesday night in the opening game of the series against their National League East rivals,
Both teams were off Mon -day, but there was no indi -cation that the teams or MLB considered moving up the start of the series, Also, there was a missed opportunity to get in Wednesday's game before heavy rain swept through the area during the afternoon.
Mendoza said he didn't have discussions with MLB 
until just before the decision was made to postpone both games at 5:11 p,m, -about two hours before the first pitch Wednesday,
""Look, my job is to manage a team,"" he said. ""We knew there was weather, but you can't predict it, We came here (Tuesday), lost a game, and we were ready to play today and we just got a call.""
With the final two games in Atlanta pushed back, the Mets could be facing an especially grueling travel schedule over the next week.
It's not out of the question that they will fly to back to Atlanta for the double header Monday, then hustle to grab another flight - ei -ther back to Milwaukee or to the West Coast - for the start of the wild card series on Tuesday should they make the playoffs."
